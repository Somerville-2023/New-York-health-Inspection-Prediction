I apologized and asked again for garlic, but the roasted garlic that Table 87 is famous for. The server grunted and yelled out for an order to be bought to the front of the store. During this time, I noticed that three other patrons arrived, for take out, and were greeted nicely, and time was given to assist them with their order.

50100336,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdmQ2cXV3RRAB,UPDATE 10/21/20: I want to add that this place is very unique among all other Subway restaurants... I would even say among all businesses. Everyone who works here is so nice. They are soooo customer oriented. I think it's because the owner of this place has a very different approach to the way customers need to be treated. After my original review I've been here more than a dozen times and every single visit I was given 2 free small cookies. This is something you'll never find in any other Subway restaurants anywhere. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've been there 2 times for the last two weeks. Both times I was served by an Asian guy. He alone deserves all my 5 stars. He does his work so neat that I decided to share my experience. What I specially like is that he doesn't rush and does his work carefully. Most of the other subway restaurants employees just throw stuff into my sandwich like there's a fire.,3 years ago,2023-11-04 14:47:35.503385,5.0,Alexey,36,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109969256719575600226/reviews?hl=en,[]

The textures and flavors of their house made bagels, pastries, and breads are spot on, and their sandwiches always hit the spot.  While I have tried nearly every sandwich on the menu, I always find myself coming back to the Reuben. I consider this particular sandwich to be my personal cheat code for feeling right. Gertie's version nails the proportions with thick cuts of corned beef and just the right amount of dressing, kraut, and cheese. I always get it with a side of fingerling potatoes + house aioli and wash it down with their draft cold brew, which is very smooth and my favorite in the neighborhood.  I've also gotta say that the staff at Gertie are fun and super attentive, which is a big part of the reason why I keep coming back (almost) every week. As far as the space itself goes, the place is bathed in natural light, which makes it feel like a breath of fresh air after being in my tiny apartment for hours on end.

We had to yell at each other, which was pretty funny, but got annoying after a while. Also partly located near the highway. There are bagels, like everywhere in New York. You will look in vain for breakfast a la a nice large plate with cheese, sausage, fruit, jam, cream cheese and other gadgets. We switch to Plates & Bowls, more precisely to the Gerties House Special. Ultimately, the plate was also a bagel, only opened up and everything that normally goes in the bagel was separated into small bowls. Was a little funny too. However, it cost $18, a lot more than a bagel. The cafe itself is bright, there is a large window front, and the preparation takes place directly behind a counter.

I asked for a medium iced Matcha latte with 3 vanilla shots instead of receiving this she put in for an original latte. I informed her of the incorrect order and instead of her trying to fix her mistake she became rude and started going back and forth with me. She said ‚Äú I ordered an iced latte Matcha with vanilla shots‚Äù. I said‚Äù exactly‚Äù. Then she goes ‚Äú no you ordered an original latte‚Äù. So one of the female workers that was making drinks at the time stopped what she was doing to apologize and correct my order. (I should‚Äôve asked for her name).

When I asked him why didn‚Äôt he use gloves on both hands, he stood there looking dumbfounded and said he did use gloves. WRONG !

He‚Äôs very rude too, you could drive up to the window and the window will be open and he doesn‚Äôt even greet you or ask you to give him a second or anything. Today I pulled up and my drink is sitting there and he‚Äôs doing a whole bunch of typing on the register so I‚Äôm thinking he‚Äôs doing my open but he had his phone out and it seemed like he was placing a large online order or something.

I had never experienced this with a beer before, but let me tell you, on a hot summer day, a light crisp beer like that with a salted glass is just heavenly. Then for food we got Spicy Falafel, Halloum, Babaganoush, and these little Lebanese marinated sausages with pine nuts whose name i unfortunately forget, but they were absolutely delicious. All the food was top notch. Halloum is like a stiffer mozzarella with a flavor of char from being grilled. The service was very fast and friendly.

BOY I was so wrong! We visited here last Saturday, on July 29th. It was a very HOT day outside. I grew up in a hot climate so my mother and I have high tolerance to heat, but when we entered the restaurant, the restaurant was INFERNO, there was no central cooling system, just a couple of fans, which were clearly not good enough for the whole restaurant. The waiters were serving lukewarm water. My mother who never drinks iced water, asked THREE times for ice, until the waiter brought ice in a glass. We ordered table lamb Shawarma, the next table also ordered table shawarma. Since shawarma tables had to be plugged in and there were not enough outlets, the waiters turned off our only fan, and plugged in our next table shawarma. So the situation turned to intolerable! No matter how many times we asked, the waiters didn‚Äôt do anything since the next door guys wanted the shawarma plugged in. My mother and I couldn‚Äôt eat and we were sweating profusely. It was like we were eating in a dry Sauna. We left.

We were living in Manhattan, and I'd bring my daughter here when we were visiting Bayside or Whitestone to go hunting for an apartment. When we found a place in Bayside, I actually (I swear to you) considered Freddy's one of the reasons for which I was happy to have moved into this area. The funny thing is, we almost never get the pizza. It's always their creamy Penne a la Vodka (served with warm Italian bread) and a large Chicken Caesar Salad... my daughter wouldn't eat salad in any other style, or from any other place. It's incredible. The guys there have been there for years, down to earth and decent ppl. Back in the pre-COVID days, you could sit in their dining area that had about a dozen 2 and 4 seat tables, and it was cozy and just a nice, bright atmosphere.

It was a simple service and I thought it was too much without consulting the costumer. In addition to that if you pay by card they charge you $5 more. For a simple dish that I did not agree with the cost, it was $19 (plus $7 juice) it was $26 with $1.69 tax (which is not correct, it is 8.875%) and they add a $5.20 tip without asking if that is my tip option.

It‚Äôs high time they train the manager  on how to talk/behave with customers. The whole exp was totally out of blue. This happened on 10/26.  We were just crossing the store and they handed a cookies and cream shake, we like what we saw and went in and requested the exact same thing and paid for it. It was filled with marshmallows, brownies on top and we got a plain shake. I mentioned about this to cashier and she said they would fix it. Few minutes later she walked out with manager and she started saying I am getting what I ordered, despite explaining what I ordered she was EXTREMELY RUDE and she was acting like she was handing over the things for free. Some people who were waking past by or if they were her bosses(not sure) intercepted and suggested to give me a refund. TBH, I have seen numerous ppl in who are not good at talking to customers, but this lady had raised the bar high! I would never set foot in this store ever again!

I spotted a promotional offer: 4 for $14, so I picked up 8. When I got to the cashier and made two stacks of 4, the server seemed puzzled and was far from pleasant. She quickly provided a price, but I tried to explain that it was for a gift and asked if she could wrap them. She looked at me with annoyance, sighed, and pointed to the card payment. She didn't offer a receipt or bid me goodbye.  A few minutes later, a friend joined me, irritated because he noticed that the discount hadn't been applied. He politely pointed it out to her, but she responded by rolling her eyes and being uncooperative. Without a receipt, I checked my mobile payment app and realized the discount hadn't been applied. I asked for an explanation, but instead of helping, the staff became increasingly unpleasant. Eventually, after a 5-minute battle, my app indicated the refund, and the cashier mumbled a sarcastic ""clever."" I left, hearing her angrily throw a cardboard box.

We were served completely flat Pepsi. Basically sweet brown water. We weren't even given the decency to be told they only had flat soda or even told they have no soda.

With 60 years in Park Slope and 30 under the same dedicated owner, this diner is a testament to timeless charm and culinary excellence.  Park Slope is a vibrant tapestry of families, young professionals, and open-minded individuals. The eclectic blend of indie boutiques, trendy eateries, and cozy bakeries along 5th and 7th Avenues makes it a haven for both locals and visitors. And as the leaves turn golden in the fall, the family-friendly ambiance of the area becomes even more enchanting.  Stepping into Daisy's Diner is like taking a delightful trip down memory lane. The classic diner ambiance, complete with the familiar counter seating, evokes a sense of nostalgia. While the decor remains largely unchanged (save for some modern light fixtures), the food is as mouthwatering as ever.  I vividly recall stepping into this quaint nook one Saturday morning, fresh from a fishing expedition with my buddies. As we regaled each other with tales of our maritime adventures, each story more grandiose than the last, the owner would sit by the counter, chuckling behind his morning paper, clearly entertained by our exaggerated recounts. Every so often, as a nod to our spirited storytelling, he'd treat the ""brave sea conquerors"" to a complimentary stack of what he fondly termed ""flapjacks."" I suspect it was his subtle way of silencing our boisterous tales, but we loved every bite of it!  On my recent visit, I indulged in a scrumptious plate of scrambled eggs with cheddar, crispy bacon, and perfectly seasoned potatoes peppered with onions. Each bite was a delightfully diner fare, reminding me of why I fell in love with this place a 45 years ago. The potatoes were notably fresh, non-greasy, and cooked to perfection.  Just as I remembered way back when.  I guess it's because they have the same cook from back then.  Though Daisy's may seem like a modest ""hole in the wall"" to some, it's a treasure trove of deliciousness. The swift service, coupled with the warm, freshly prepared dishes, makes every visit worthwhile.  In conclusion, if you're in Park Slope and seeking a classic diner experience that's both authentic and delectable, Daisy's Diner is the place to be. Here's to many more years of delightful dishes and cherished memories! üç≥ü•ìüçÅ",2 months ago,2023-11-04 16:59:38.365436,5.0,Maximilian D.

I liked it... the place just keeps going back further and further with row after row of cool 'secluded type' booth seating ...to a window in the back looking out at a parking lot and 'mod type' tallish building.  There is an exit door to the parking lot but I don't know if it is used a lot.  We sat in the back.  Lots of room.  The whole place is a 'frayed at the edges' / 'lived in' but totally lovable.  It is not dirty but 'worn.'  It is an 'aged nicely' look like someone would buy at IKEA (a 'distressed' piece of furniture, that is).  I should have brought my camera-phone to take pictures... there are 'picture worthy' things.  It was a second night out for me and the extended family ...Mom, her (our) friend and part of the family that were somewhere else for Thanksgiving were there (six of us).  It was roomy and they were very accommodating at Daisy's ...the waitress was on her game and attentive.  Refills, extras items... good friendly attitude.  I ordered 'Cajun Glazed' Chicken... it was tasty, came out on three plates & a fourth to hold a gravy cup (that I shared with my friend right across from who had a brisket sliced thing on mashed potatoes.  ""It was a good amount of food"" (and could have easily fed me and someone else or be 'take home' as well) I think that is the idea here... as I looked at everyone having 'LG Size potions.'  Like I said... it's been here a while and the patrons plus staff are laid back (but not lazy) ...like a comfortable living room (it's the local living room for sure) ...or like the 'clubhouse' you and your friends had with a bunch of different types of furniture (and a patched hole in a bench seat).  I want to stress again that the food was good... large amounts, decent prices ...and the surroundings, charming, cozy... to include good service and round the clock hours.  No one in my group even mentioned anything that put them off and we all just enjoyed the eating and talking (like everyone else there in their own private worlds).",11 months ago,2023-11-04 17:00:00.536892,5.0,Evan McNeeley,160,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107414796028922128203/reviews?hl=en,[]

Never had a Mezcal pairing with food before, but this clean freshness of some seriously authentic Mexican flavors, coupled with the smoky and sweet at times, I will not soon forget. I hope to return often. One Michelin star, very affordable, with the largest Mezcal collection I've ever seen.

The management only hired one waiter and one busboy for the restaurant during peak brunch hours and they were clearly overwhelmed. The service was subpar not due to their performance but due to the poor management not knowing when their restaurant is actually busy.  The drinks took about an hour to come out after we sat down. The drinks themselves were pretty good in comparison. It was just coffee and bellini, nothing complicated.  I ordered an omelette that took even longer to come out. It was overcooked and hard. It had hair on it (pictured). The waiter took the dish back and gave me $1.50 off. Normally when you have hair show up in your food you would get a new dish or the item comped. Taking off $1.50 just made the experience worse on top of the service.  For that experience, I had to pay 20% gratuity (included in the bill) and then are asked to tip even more on the receipt.

When we arrived, we wanted to check out the menu they had out front to make sure they had the food we were interested in potentially getting. The hostess ran outside to greet us and then stared at us until we decided that we would try it out. It was uncomfortable how desperate they seemed to want to get customers in the door. Our waiter came by our table and wasn't very friendly at first, but then made a quick joke with us and took our drink order. We got the drinks pretty quickly and our food order was taken. We ordered an appetizer together and then each got an entree. The entrees came out first and when we asked about the appetizer, he said that they were making it fresh and it would be nice and hot (however, we specifically asked to start with the appetizer). We didn't end up getting the appetizer until we were about halfway done with our meal. Our waiter NEVER came by to check on us or ask how our meal was. Someone else came by and asked to clear our plates and we asked for a a couple of boxes for our leftovers. He came back with boxes and a bag, and we bagged everything up and then waited about 10 minutes for our check. Once our waiter came and took our card, he left with it and then was just talking to people at the bar. He handed over a bunch of checks to a waitress and she finished the transaction with us.

Mama Mia was a short walk from the parking garage and and even closer to the theater.  I ordered the Aperol Spritz. It was perfectly made. Our meal consisted of a side of Meatballs. Perfect Grandma Style Meatballs. Crispy outside, moist and full of flavor inside. Smothered in the house Marinara. Samantha had Basil Pesto with Chicken and Sundried Tomatos. She cleaned the plate and it was a huge portion. She really  loved it. I had one of the best Eggplant Parmasean dinners ever. Thin layers of creamy....almost meaty Eggplant stacked high. Smothered with delicious Grandma style sauce and perfectly finished with cheese.  Not fancy. Attentive staff and service. Here it's all about the food. Generous portions, served hot and full of slow cooked flavor. All that with fair prices for the quality of the food this is a solid neighborhood spot.  Mama Mia has been in business for 51 years.

Not only did I leave this establishment unfulfilled it was also very clear that we were unwanted. For starters the host is a disgusting human being! The way she treated us and looked at us when we walked in was beyond unacceptable. Not only was she rude she also served us our drinks which were basically watered down and warm. We had a reservation and arrived early because we were traveling from New Jersey and  your host treated us as if we did not belong. We were also rushed to order so we decided to move outside so we could be more comfortable. This is where things got worse. They sat us under a table which had no heater knowing it was freezing outside. Finally another waitress came outside got us a decent drink then disappeared! The food came out cold and it was just as disgusting as the customer service. Lastly after being insulted by multiple members of your staff we asked for the check and that‚Äôs when the manager/owner came out and asked for our feedback. How dare you wait until we leave to care about the way your employees treated us. From the moment we moved outside it should have been obvious there was an issue don‚Äôt wait until we pay to check on us! Brunch season is approaching but between the service and the flavorless food don‚Äôt waste your time here!

50003105,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbC1tSTRBRRAB,"I hosted a private event at Oliver's, and it was a seamless experience from start to finish, all of which is attributed to the people I've worked with throughout various stages of the event (thank you so much Kim, Phil, and Hannah!)  I booked the Landmark Lounge, which is their private rooms downstairs, for a surprise 30th birthday party for my husband. It was the perfect size for the 20 of us (plenty of sitting and standing space), and is beautifully decorated throughout. As this was for a birthday party, we got minimal decor in black and gold, which matched perfectly with the color scheme of the space.  There is no rental fee for the space, but there is a minimum that must be met via food and/or drinks - note that it's not just the host's bill, but everyone else's bill that contributes to meeting the minimum. Because I had ordered an assortment of food platters for the party, I had already surpassed the minimum myself, but it's great to know for those looking for an affordable/easy minimum option.  As for the event itself, the quality of service we've received was top notch - from my constant back and forth emails with Kim about the event, to doing a mini tour of the venue with Phil and him taking care of all my concerns (before and during the event), to Hannah effortlessly serving our group of 20 and making sure we all had a drink in our hands, I was impressed and blown away. They really went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with everything and I truly appreciate the level of attentiveness they carried through the entirety of the event.  The food was all delicious - you can order platters ahead of time, and the serving sizes are quite generous. I over-ordered for my group, which is fine (better that than not ordering enough), as my guests happily took home leftovers. Drinks were very reasonably priced and delicious as well!

The hospitality in big cities is terrible and it's getting worse , it's ridiculous .  The places with already built names and good locations are doing fine and making money with terrible customer service , while most of the business are struggling , so i just want to help the places that they are not well known with good customer service, they deserve more attention. Just to direct people where to spend their money for an already overpriced city with terrible hospitality !  This place had a big video projector showing the World Cup games , it was Thursday so I decided to watch the game .  Guessing that they want to attract customers interested in World Cup i stop by and i was very clear with the host that i would like to watch the game and have few drinks , the video projector was in the middle of the restaurant so you cant watch it from the bar , she gave me a small standing table near the video projector  . The restaurant was not full .  Meanwhile the restaurant get busier , i already had two margaritas it was after second half when she approach me telling me that they have reservation for that table , clearly they wanted to fit more people , she suggest me to move on the bar which was full and it was very hard to watch the game from that position . I paid my check i didn't leave a tip and i left the place , one block away i found much better service .  If you show the game especially with projector then you are inviting people to watch the game , i guess is weekday and you believe you will need some extra profit from the game (from drinks) , in contrary if you are confident and you have enough customers then you don't play the game , or maybe just the bar .

The flavors were good, and could have been great and the presentation WAS great, but if it's not cooked properly that doesnt make up for it.

Had to wait about 5 mins for someone to come out of the back that ""speaks English"" but she really doesn't speak English. Pretty much tells me they don't care about your business if your not fluent in Spanish.  I ordered a 3 piece fried chicken. The chicken is seasoned really well. The problem is it's nearly impossible to get a fresh piece of chicken. Seems like the chicken is fried once or twice a day and just sits under a heating lamp all day. The breading is stale, this should be expected for chicken that was cooked hours ago.  Another thing that pissed me off was that this is one of those places that doesn't add tax to their prices UNLESS you pay with your card. And the tax isn't really tax, it's to cover their transaction fees. I hate when business do this. It's illegal (I work in credit card processing, I know what I'm talking about). Long story short this is a horribly ran business, I'll never go back inside of this place.

41585586,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwaTl6RzN3RRAB,"Worst curry I have ever had and that includes some I made in grad school from a jar using a microwave. - 40% giant pieces of onions - random other stuff that was not supposed to in there, like roasted potatoes and fried tofu - barely any of the ingredients that the menu said you are getting.  Three pieces of eggplant and a few leaves of tasteless basil. -The actual curry sauce?  Consistency of a soup.  Basically, take a quarter of a jar of leftover curry sauce, rinse it out with equal amount of water.  There you have it.  I would have sent my food back except this was the evening when I was saying goodbye to my son who is just starting college.  And at least his sesame chicken looked decent.  Service:  it started out good with a smiling waitress bringing us iced water.  Then I asked for water without ice instead (really cold things don‚Äôt agree with me), and that was the end of the smiles.  The place is supposed to be open until 10:00. But already at 9:20 people kept coming by to see if we were ready to get out.  I was holding chopsticks in my hand when one of them asked if he should take my plate.  Too bad because the place looked so nice.

The food sushi, General Tso's Chicken, Schezuan Beef, soup, deserts, drinks were excellent as well. I love the ambiance, the lighting was perfect. Only thing is that people at the bar and hibachi area can get loud and annoying but have some warm sake and you will fit right in. I really like this place since Hunan Balcony and our other favorite restaurant China Fun closed, this is definitely my family's new favorite restaurant.  This is an Update: July 9th 2023***  My family and I have ordered Nikko for delivery through UberEats several times but today my family member ordered two different dinners soups and salads including an appetizer crab Shumai. Food seemed a bit unorganized and shuffled in the bag but bag was stapled as usual, everything was spilled and leaking that was unusual generally when when we received an order every thing is organized and no soups leaking.  Upon eating two  bites of the shrimp and broccoli and General Tso's and crab Shumai. I immediately threw up, this food was completely rotten and had a chemically taste. I cannot believe we ate some of this rotten food, everything had to be thrown out immediately after consuming a bit of the food we all became ill from the chemically taste and realized the putrid smells fumigating from the bag it was delivered in this is definitely a food safety issue  and I hope the food inspectors will investigate thier kitchen and cooks  Unfortunately we will not be ordering again. I hope this restaurant will realize just how fast they can lose great customers by not checking the quality of the food they send out to their loyal customers. I'm very disappointed in this place as we have been ordering here for a while now. But fortunately for us there are many other great Chinese/Thai restaurants who  have better quality control and will not deliver rotten/chemically tasting food  to their customers.",3 months ago,2023-11-05 12:28:57.711916,1.0,Raven Black,32,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109276459101973049939/reviews?hl=en,['Food: 1']

41585586,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobVBLNUVnEAE,"If you‚Äôre looking for a hibachi restaurant where the chefs do tricks with the food you probably shouldn‚Äôt go here because they didn‚Äôt really do that.  Instead, chefs squirt sake into the mouths of customers from a bottle and toss food at them to see who can catch it in their mouth.  I didn't find anything wrong with this and the customers seemed to enjoy it.  But, keep in mind that this is a Japanese restaurant, not a hibachi restaurant.  Other than that, the chef and most of the staff were friendly and the food was good.  The reason why I'm giving the restaurant three stars is because of some other things that happened while I was there. One of the chefs was Hispanic which pleasantly surprised me.  I noticed that one of the Asian staff members was constantly watching the Hispanic chef while he worked.  This man had such an obvious disdain for him that it made me uncomfortable.  He would glare at him and whisper to another staff member (I‚Äôm going to assume about him) who seemed less interested in what he had to say.  He never looked at the other chef who was working (who happened to be Asian) just at the Hispanic one.  Maybe he had some personal beef with the man, but it went on for quite some time and was so blatant that it was shocking.  There was also another Asian man there whose role and function was not clear, but seemed to be managing the staff.  A Hispanic boy was working there (he looked very young, like a teenager).  The man in charge started yelling at him and then he called him stupid before the boy disappeared into another part of the restaurant.  The whole exchange happened right in front of me.  I didn‚Äôt say anything because I didn‚Äôt want to make more trouble for the boy.  I don‚Äôt know what his situation is and he may really need that job.  But, to be verbally abusive and to do it in front of customers, I have no words.  For those who would accuse me of being nosey I say, I usually don‚Äôt notice anything going on around me while I‚Äôm eating.  Also, this all happened right next to my table, not feet from me.

I was happy with the noodles, and somewhat happy with my filet.  While a bit flavorful, I felt it lacked seasoning.  There were a few fatty parts which is surprising for a filet, but it was definitely good enough to finish up.  The sauces that the chef gave us along with our dishes helped bring my filet to life.  My only concern was the portion size.  I feel they could have tossed some more noodles in my dish because I was still quite hungry after finishing my food.  Also, I asked for no veggies and was wondering if they could add more noodles or anything else (obviously not the Filet) to make up for it.  Nope, the waiter told me no veggies means no veggies, and that I do not get extras of other food if I choose this.  While I get it, noodles and rice are cheap to make; you think you could have given me something? These little things go a long way because the idea of eating is also not to be hungry anymore.  The substitution probably could have helped with that, but that is their rules and it is what it is.  The hibachi chef we had was quite nice as well, so I would overall say this was a decent experience.

They didn‚Äôt seem to be way overpriced (looking at you Benihana) and offered a wide variety of options.  Unfortunately, i can‚Äôt recommend this restaurant.   While the staff was pleasant and the ‚Äúchefs‚Äù tried to entertain you while they cooked you meal, they failed everywhere else:  1.  They try to seat as many people as possible around the hibachis.  To the point you are elbow to elbow.  Might be ok if it were entirely your own party, but not for a communion table.  2.  The food.  While the ingredients seemed to be fresh, what they add to it is way too much.  You can barely taste the difference between the different proteins.  I had steak and scallops.  Also too much sodium and oil.  3.  Timing.  They give you exactly one hour to complete your meal from the time you are seated.  45 minutes in they begin offering you boxes to take away and left over food.  At no time do they come around asking if you would like another drink, dessert, etc.",a year ago,2023-11-05 12:29:44.224465,2.0,Leo Seymour,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100963302876814162315/reviews?hl=en,[]

Never had such a disrespectful experience anywhere in my life until i decide to step into this place. I was waiting on the line when a customer cut me off and i mentioned to my other half who was standing next to me. Long story short one of the staff a slim tall woman with glasses who was serving another customer at that time decided to talk to the customer that cut the line and make fun about the situation saying "" why you cut the line miss don't you know you not suppose to do that"" and started laughing with the customer like its okay with what she did. They both carried on for minutes while i was still standing in line waiting. The customer seems like an acquaintance to the staff but regardless everyone should be treated  fairly and wait there turn. My better half and I ended up leaving without buying anything as i was very upset and felt very uncomfortable. For me this is disrespectful and unprofessional and those types of staff needs proper training.  I will never go there again and i wudn't recommend my family and Friends either. I prefer to buy elsewhere where where i am treated fairly and with respect.  Mr. Owner thank you for the apology. However, I know what an online order is.

It came out piping hot and remained that way for the entire meal. The walnut shrimp plate was a delight as well, I was super happy that even the broccoli was well seasoned. The salt level was great and freshness of the shrimp. The quality of the meat in the sweet-and-sour chicken was exactly what we were hoping for. Usually restaurants slack off in this department because it‚Äôs fried and covered in sauce but this plate did not disappoint.  In addition to these three main course options we had an order of white rice on the side and enjoyed the lovely tea. Usually we go to Chinatown for this style of cuisine but appears we have this gem among us here in Brooklyn. As we were eating we noticed a lot of people had some beautiful and extravagant dishes being dropped off to their table. Can‚Äôt wait to go back and try more ( like one of the meat platters or the lobster fried rice).  This place is definitely recommended for family style dining because all of the portions are so huge and definitely worth sharing. This place would also be great for a celebration, they have bigger tables and once all the food is on the table it all looks so beautiful and special. Not sure if they have drinks because we ended up drinking the tea that was served on arrival the whole time.

My friend group had not been together in several years so they were really excited and admittedly a little rambunctious. Jessica was calm and professional the entire time. Her service and coordination never lagged despite the distraction so kudos again to her.  The food itself was GREAT. We had a large group so we pretty much ordered everything on the menu. The Vietnamese chicken wings were a hit. I was partial to the Kalbi Short Ribs. My belly was happy as was the camera lens on my phone.  Speaking of which, I couldn't help but keep glancing around at the decor. It set up a great dimly lit atmosphere for dining. I'm not sure I've ever seen any of the elements used in any other space. We dined inside though I would've requested outdoor seating had I planned the shindig. The tables on the top floor were a little close for my comfort but not enough for me to sound an alarm.  Bottom line: You should go! Maybe you'll be lucky enough to have Jessica as your host/waitress. If you're driving, take a close look at the sparking situation.

The ambiance and setting of the place itself made up for it.  I would say that the OBAO at Hell's Kitchen is a perfect place to go for a night outing with a party of 2-3; anything else and you will be overdoing it. ------------------------------------------------ What Lead Me To Come Here: I went to OBAO because I was planning a dinner for my graduation celebration. Making the reservation was not difficult, but the handling and confusion of the bill was. I made the reservation through website and called later to confirm my reservation with them.  Upon finalization, I received a party form that was sent by the OBAO staff regarding my bill for the night. This form confirmed the food that you've selected, the # of people in your party, and the amount that you will be paying for the night (which for me was changed as I paid at the actual place). In addition to that, they also ask for the payment method that you'll be using for the dinner.  Realistically, that was pointless to do since they charged me the full bill (including the additional purchases made) there. ------------------------------------------------ The Process of the Fee: - They charge for the party that you stated was going to come (So make sure everyone comes)  - Paid a $100 deposit fee ------------------------------------------------ My Setting: - Had a Party of 15",5 months ago,2023-11-05 13:01:21.621103,4.0,Jacob Agwu,2,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110654104619467355756/reviews?hl=en,"['Service Dine in', 'Meal type Dinner', 'Price per person $50‚Äì100']"

41561516,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbHZ2cE93EAE,"Good Food! I'll give you the one star for that. 0 stars for BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE and RUDE host This was for Saturday, April 22, 2023 at around 430 PM I made reservations for 4 people for a 5 PM dinner. 2 of us arrived early and ordered drinks and appetizers at the bar with the third person following prior to our reservation. The 4th person who was visiting from London got driven to the wrong restaurant by Uber and texted me saying she will be delayed. They won't seat us as a policy. That's fine, and I understand that.  However, one of us had to leave early and would need to sit and eat. We already ordered our food from the bar and paid for it.  We requested to get seated and transferred but they won't let unless we downgrade to 3 people. The host vehemently warned that we cannot change the number of people if I did.  I explained the situation and said if we could be seated, we can figure out how to proceed when the friend arrived.  The host proceeded to seat us in a corner for 3. There was an empty table with 4 chairs. I said why not there, what's the difference of letting us sit at a 4 person table. They agreed. However, as soon as we sat down, they took away the 4th chair to make a point that we cannot have our friend join us.  I wanted to leave and move restaurants at that point but we had already ordered and paid for our food and drinks. The lost friend arrived 20 mins later as we were still eating dinner. Mind you, there was no line outside and there were empty tables around us. They refused her entry saying we only had 3 seats.  I waved at my friend from my seat, but the host was telling her she cannot come in because there was no seat for her.  Please speak to your friend, they only have a reservation for 3.   A restaurant in NYC that does this to their clients is not good.  It's unkind, unprofessional, and just not flexible when situations arise.  We had visitors from overseas, and this was how they were treated. There are tons of very good restaurants on 9th avenue and this should not be the case.  I was waving to my friend to join us since there was space at our table, but no chair.  The restaurant was stopping her from coming in. My other friend who had to leave early, gave up her seat to my other friend who arrived.  Only then, did they let her come in, because there are only 3 CHAIRS at our table.  The rude host refused  to give her a menu when she asked and only when my other friend left did they give her a menu begrudgingly. Their reasoning was it gives more work to the kitchen to have a secondary order. This is complete BS.  I asked to speak to a manager to explain the situation and complain about the rudeness.  She was nodding and saying she will speak to the host. However, she never apologized or tried to diffuse the situation.  I will never set foot again at OBAO, nor will I recommend this place to anyone I know. In fact, I will make sure to let people know how bad their service is.  Please, do not patronize restaurants that treat their customers like this.  Inflexible and not helpful.

The Huevos con chorizo used to another huge platter of perfectly soft scrambled eggs with ground real Spanish choriz - now this is served literally on tiny side plate with a little dollop of beans.   To make matters worse, whatever they use now, (although the manager swore it was chorizo)  tastes like Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage.  Chorizo has a very distinct paprika flavor, and sorry whatever they use now is NOT Chorizo    either way the eggs were dried out and the ""chorizo@ was cut into clumsily cut chunks.  I promptly sent that back and nibbled on the tiny remnant of the minature Cuban sandwich.  Not bad, just much smaller than it used to be.   To make matters worse. the service (which was never great) is now even worse given the large outdoor area which makes getting the attention of either of the servers next to impossible.   So sadly i won't waste my time waiting 20minutes for an undersized, over priced meal. - for the price and quality, there are now way better spots in Nolita to enjoy.   Scratch this one off the list ....",a year ago,2023-11-05 13:08:33.731718,1.0,John Stewart,1,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103885259507494879200/reviews?hl=en,[]

I understand restaurants tend to make their general tso‚Äôs sauce less spicy for the general population, which is why I asked for extra spice. despite the instructions, the sauce was still plainly sweet and lacking its‚Äô spicy counterpart. they didn‚Äôt include broccoli either, which is part of the dish. also, no flavor in the pork fried rice despite it looking appetizing.",a month ago,2023-11-05 14:34:27.320655,5.0,William Ye,101,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100233290066485547215/reviews?hl=en,"['Food: 5', 'Service: 5', 'Atmosphere: 5']"

40537963,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSa1BiTVNBEAE,The worst Chinese food around!!  $25.00 for a Sesame chicken (2023)  Here was the experience: There was 1 waitress for the entire fully seated restaurant and she did not come to take my order and she did not ask me a single time if I needed anything.  There was terrible service.  The front manager was the only one who took my order and refilled my water.  The chicken rice soup side dish was disgusting.  It was cheap instant powdered soup powder in water with some rice in it.  The general Tsos chicken had burned sauce and burned chili‚Äôs.  The sesame chicken portion arrived not very hot and it was overcooked and dry. To me it seems like a weak effort at imitating other authentic Chinese restaurants.  I would not recommend this place.

The sweet & sour chicken is wrapped with breading filler to look like bigger chicken nuggets, while the chicken peices inside were actually small. (stringy almost ‚Å∞tasteless dry chicken too, not juicy)  The roast pork fried rice used to have huge 1/2"" square chunks of pork, now the pork size is the same as most other chinese take out, 1/4"" square.  I was put on hold as soon as he answered & felt like he was rushing me afterwards. All business personality, almost cold, like I did something wrong. No hospitality over phone, sounded like he was either mad at something (ratings?) or just having a bad day, everyone knows if your serving the public you have to appear to be nice as it might affect your business.  Then, the delivery guy (maybe it was the guy who took the order!) took $20.00 tip instead of $10.00 like I told him out loud for him to hear but he took my three $20.00 bills & gave me $10.00 back. My order was only $29.00. Real Slick.  Now that I saw that past review about the huge roach, I wont be ordering from them anymore anyway.  The fortune cookies were stale too, they didnt snap open just bent slowly.  The positives: They still give pleanty of sauces & a fruit in the bag & yes that famous Pistatio ice cream with cherries is still awesome.",3 years ago,2023-11-05 14:35:00.207608,3.0,Mitchull Moroz,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111654762085385476530/reviews?hl=en,[]

I ordered chicken lo mein there was no vegetables inside I ordered fried rice it was just a fried rice with the beef that I ordered have no vegetables in the rice at all no egg no carrots peas onions scallions. I was very disappointed the way they just stir-fried the food and gave it to you without putting the components of the recipe inside the dish. The owner was very nice but the chef in the back is not doing a great job. I will give this place one more try before I decide not to eat there anymore.

We asked to move where they placed us in a high top next to the bar. We could barely fit so we eventually waited for seats at the bar. The menu seemed great..we went with the pork belly, mushrooms and gnocci. Pork belly was good but very big for two people since it's so fatty/oily.

The gnocchi was a nice portion,  but they were in a bed of butter. Maybe we ordered the wrong items. The tastes all blended together and by the end we couldn't handle anymore fat without the flavor.

The meat was so tasty and tender and the hummus and Israeli salad were awesome. They have some many toppings but it was first time so I went with the safe choices. Next time I am planning on trying the laffa it looked so good and it was large enough to feed two. My order came with a side coleslaw and small order of fries.

Despite being early for dinner due to another commitment, the accommodating staff graciously attended to my needs.  Nestled across the beautiful Madison Square Park, the restaurant's location is picture-perfect. The alfresco dining experience and the serene park view were refreshing and calming. The weather was in my favor, and I chose a curbside table shaded by vibrant red umbrellas.  My dinner commenced with a basket of freshly baked bread and a small plate of butter doused in a tasty sauce; both were served promptly even though the restaurant wasn't officially ready for dinner service. The service was commendable. The waiting staff was courteous and professional, showcasing the restaurant's dedication to its patrons.  The food was nothing short of excellent. Each dish was meticulously prepared and presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner. My appetizer, Bone Marrow, was made with Manila clams, a lemon-herb crumb, and a shallot reduction, creating a harmonious blend of flavors. The main course, Grilled Amish Chicken, was tender, succulent, and served with white bean and leek ravioli, charred ramps, garlic crumbs, and parmesan. Each bite was a testament to the chef's craftsmanship.  The pricing was very reasonable for the food quality and the service rendered. Furthermore, the restaurant features an onsite bar that serves an array of alcoholic beverages, making it an excellent place for an after-work rendezvous or a weekend night out.  However, there were a couple of areas that could use some attention. The staff, while courteous, seemed unsure when asked about the specific culinary style of the dishes served. While it was eventually categorized as American cuisine, it would benefit the team to understand the restaurant offerings better. The Diet Coke was also slightly off, being a bit watery and less effervescent than expected for such a high-end establishment.  The superior elements of the dining experience quickly overshadowed these minor issues. The decaffeinated coffee I ended my meal with was a highlight - rich, aromatic, not too strong, and served with an array of sweeteners in a charming mug. The ambiance and layout of the restaurant also deserve mention, as the spacious interior and well-spaced tables ensured a private and comfortable dining experience.  In conclusion, my experience at Blackbarn Restaurant was a delightful one. The slight opportunities for improvement do not detract from the overall high-quality dining experience. I eagerly anticipate my next visit to sample more of their exquisite dishes.

50034379,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4cFBIZFd3EAE,"To start off, Blackbarn is incredible. If you‚Äôre considering going to this restaurant, don‚Äôt think twice, just book a reservation and go. To start, the restaurant has an abundance of room and feels like a brief escape from the city with all of the wood detail in the interior. Our server was very friendly and attentive, and was happy to make recommendations for us.  The first course: bread basket. This basket came with three different options to pair with a pat of butter sitting in garlic confit and flaky salt. Divine.  Second course: tuna tartare that tasted so light and fresh, octopus with a red pepper hummus and greens, and bone marrow with clams. The only dish I didn‚Äôt really care for was the bone marrow, but I think it‚Äôs just too fatty of a dish for me! My friend really enjoyed it. The octopus was well cooked and I loved the combination with the hummus.  Main course: fall off the bone ribs. Don‚Äôt sleep on this dish!! Even if you‚Äôre out at a business dinner, order the ribs. They used to have shoestring fries and have since been replaced by steak fries. We asked if we could upgrade to the parm fries instead and were told there would be a fee, and we were a bit disappointed to see us being charged for an entire side of fries, when we were under the impression it would just be an upgrade fee. It also comes with a cucumber salad which is a great light compliment to the overall dish, but our waiter forgot to bring it out and I had to separately ask for the cucumber salad. Don‚Äôt let that discourage you though, order the ribs‚Ä¶and to the restaurant‚Ä¶ please bring back the shoestring fries! We also ordered the truffle ricotta gnocchi and it tasted like little fluffy clouds of creamy truffle gnocchi. Cannot recommend this enough.  Dessert: bread pudding with house made vanilla bean ice cream, and a Granny Smith apple custard shortbread situation. If you‚Äôre going to order one thing outside of the ribs, make it the bread pudding. I would go the the restaurant just for that dessert alone. It was heavenly!  TLDR: order the ribs and the bread pudding. Everything on the menu is incredible. Please bring back the shoestring fries.",5 months ago,2023-11-05 14:45:24.389407,5.0,sarah laskaris,83,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106983079846057955859/reviews?hl=en,"['Service Dine in', 'Meal type Dinner', 'Price per person $100+', 'Recommended dishes Rum Butterscotch Bread Pudding']"

First, for the price of such an exclusive table, the chef never introduced himself to myself - the main patron - nor the table. Secondly, none of the dishes were announced; the waiters rushed each plate while serving us: cold rack of lamb, dry BBQ ribs and flavorless pizza. Not to mention several other dishes that were subpar at best. The waiters would mumble to us then retreat back into the kitchen. My party planner was charged an enormous erroneous fee because apparently Blackbarn thinks black, professional patrons are ""loud and unruly"". She was falsely charged for absolutely nothing. We were a table comprised of CFOs, SVPs of major firms and city officials - why would we conduct ourselves as ""loud and unruly""?! Thankfully, after speaking with one of the managers the following week, she was reimbursed. But not before him telling us that his waitress - a black female that was the only saving grace that night - was poorly tipped. Um, why is the most expensive reservation not kicking back it's fees to the main waitress' overall final tip? And why is their poor business model for their staff the problem of the guests - who left more than 20%?? I would advise NO ONE RESERVE THE CHEF TABLE.

Started out with the drink walking through the forest with hibiscus gin it was delicious and refreshing.  Must haves of the night: the fig pizza was delicious, also the duck breast and sausage sounded quite strange on the menu however it was prepared perfectly. Very tender and well seasoned. The Seabass my mother had and it was honestly very good as well. Bread basket was top tier as well as the rum butterscotch bread pudding a perfect way to end the night  Good but not needed: the tuna tartare was very good just a bit average to what u can find else where same with the shishito peppers. The butternut squash ravioli was good as well however it's very filling and wasn't a stand out of the night.  Could live without: the only thing I personally didn't like was the chicken wings. I got them for my sister who loved them however I wasn't that impressed. It was a bit too Smokey and tasted almost charred.

While i have heard of this place via social media review, i had never had a chance to try it until now.  Upon entering I found out they were closing soon, the waitress were kind enough to accept us as the last table for the night. I measured my temperature and recorded my name in accordance to the Covid-19 measure and sat down. I ordered their pork cream pasta and rose spicy rice cake with their mild spicy. The food came out relatively quickly.  I am not sure if I was just hungry but oh boy the food was good. The pork cream pasta's sauce is Japanese curry-based. While there was not a lot of noodle, it tasted delicious and well cooked. I enjoyed the sauce base so much i ordered a side of white rice just to make good of the left over curry sauce from the pasta.  the rice cake was packed with goodies. From glass noodle / fish cake / lettuce / sausage / rice cake...etc. The rice cake was well-cooked and chewy and the ingredient tasted fresh. I was satisfied and filled from eating the pasta and that we end up getting the rice cake to go.  even though they were closing for the day; the waitress did not rush us to finish and gave ample comfortable time to enjoy the entrees.  I definitely would return to this place again and try out more of the other variety on the menu.

Firstly, I didn't like a spicy food for life, but yupdduk totally changes me into it. I ordered delivery super mild assorted yupdduk and mini rice balls, and its combination was KILL. It was not spicy at all, but tasty. Secondly, they have a super fast delivery and almost no fees. I got my food within 30 minutes (maybe because I live around yupdduk), but it was impressive, anyway.  I use seamless for delivery most likely, but I couldn't find yupdduk there. And I went their website, there is one link for delivery service, which may yupdduk works with them. They have super low fee for delivery, super fast and I got 3% cash back points! I really love what I've experienced with yupdduk, I will definitely tell all my friends, and share with all reviewers, too.

50075161,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3dzdUdnlnRRAB,"If you want Korean comfort food or need some spicy food to perk you up, this is a good place to go! They have a variety of options and execute on them well, to the point where you would think that the cast iron skillet was born for fried rice, mozzarella, and corn!  I do wish they would make a few minor tweaks in the food, such as having an all white meat option for their chicken entr√©es or being able to serve their hamburgers with 100% beef instead of a pork blend.  The service isn't bad either and they have free delivery. Some of the servers seem shy though if you don't speak or look like you can't speak Korean. I try not to blame them - when I went to Korea, I kept praying the locals would keep the conversation short and not notice my lack of skills.  I'm also surprised by so many local guides in Flushing ranting about prices in this area, as the price range should be a separate category from the dining experience. Then again, guess we were all price sensitive when we were younger and haven't yet worked for a living - as someone who's done some analysis and commercial real estate before, it's safe to say that the price range here is right, considering the location, inflation rate (it's not the '90s anymore), wages (which translates to the cost of living in Flushing), and cost of goods. If you want to complain, then it may be more productive to write to your local reps about all the foreign investors and affiliated developers buying up all the land and parking their money here (note that many areas in and around Flushing is competitive with parts of Manhattan - and even more interesting is that retail rents has been generally falling there, while in contrast, is still rising in Flushing).",5 years ago,2023-11-05 14:48:12.537177,4.0,Paul Park,55,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116119956274657045362/reviews?hl=en,[]

Anyhow, you gotta try their kimchi fried rice. theres just something about rice and cheese that makes this dish really taste. there chips in it that gives it a crunch, corn which makes it sweet, bacon which makes it savory, and kimchi which makes is spicy.

50075161,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURncTk2aWlBRRAB,"Came for lunch after hearing a lot about this place. The bottom line - food was ok but not at this price range. First of all, people have to understand that spicy rice cakes are street food (aka cheap and going). We got the lunch special with the spicy rice cakes and kimchee and bacon fried rice combo. It cost $28 after tax (note these lunch specials are sized for 2 people). At that price for lunch, I'm expecting pretty amazing. If this lunch cost $15, it would have been pretty amazing. Details: the food is spicy! We asked for mild and it was sweat inducing. My wife, who can stand heat, said it was pretty spicy. The rice cakes have a nice chewiness. The mini sausages (there were only 2) were really good with a nice snap. The cheese (I hear that like the sauce, it's imported from Korea) gave it a nice creaminess that helped offset the heat a little. The fried rice was terrific conceptually. But if you're going to say bacon, it better taste like it has bacon! This had no trace of the porcine pleasure. Similarly, not really too much noticeable kimchee either. Again, the cheese helps cut the spiciness and helps hold it all together. Service was good. But as others may have already noted, this isn't like a full service Korean restaurant so they didn't have any banchan. Also, typically these type of places give out mini yogurt drinks with the bill. Nope, none of that here either. We came around 12 and the place was half full.

On the bright side, the outdoor atmosphere was nice, and the service was amicable, but the food was simply horrible. Please do not waste your time or money eating here.  I had the pad kee mao and ginger sauce dishes with beef and while the portions were hefty and will fill you up, I felt that the taste and quality of food was lacking. The vegetables, as you can see in the pictures, look grimy and appear to not have been washed. I appreciate the abundance of vegetables on the dishes but there appeared to be some rotten cuts of vegetables that left little to be desired.  I found the noodles on my pad kee mao to be quite soggy and over cooked, whereas the ginger sauce dish was very salty and the rice needed to be mixed in to balance the salinity of the dish. I also wish there was some spice and finesse to the dishes served. While the plates may have been colorful, I was not fully satisfied with the flavors of each dish.  Would I come back here again? Absolutely not.

Unpopular opinion: expecting tips on to-go orders is out of hand; and I'm a waiter of ten years in NYC. Summer 2020 was a different story and circumstance. These days, I've reverted back a bit. If I've come once or twice to pick-up my food and we've built a rapport b/c your service is solid, kind, and memorable, then awesome - I'm happy to tip. Maybe I'm biased b/c my FOH team doesn't expect to be tipped on to-go orders, and I'm constantly comparing the service quality of others to ours.  Apparently, choosing to support this establishment is not enough. Your business is not appreciated unless you give the person at pick-up something extra, or they will call you out in front of other guests in line.

50035721,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhMHJtUU13EAE,"Just Salad literally the salad bar of my dreams. They offer plentiful salad options, wraps, smoothies, soups, bowls and more. The ingredients were fresh and bursting with flavor. I ordered the crispy chicken poblano salad and the avo blast toast- a combo deal for less than $15. They have a ‚Äúyou pick 2‚Äù option where you can choose a medium salad and a smoothie, wrap, soup, chips & drink, etc. What a steal! The portions were large enough that I had leftovers. Both were beautifully prepared by a prep cook named Miles, and everything exceeded my expectations. If I lived near a Just Salad, I would probably eat here daily.  What I love most about Salad Bar, however, goes beyond my taste buds. Salad Bar is committed to sustainability and promotes zero waste and plant-based diets. Everything is served in compostable materials, and they even offer reusable salad bowls. Just Salad is also on Too Good To Go, an app committed to the reduction of food waste. Ordering through that app is a great option for those of us on a tight budget. If you are a salad queen like me, you need to try Just Salad as soon as possible!",2 years ago,2023-11-05 15:26:56.998872,5.0,Nikki Loseff,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102542667643694269765/reviews?hl=en,[]

I went here since at jury duty,  and was the only one in the restaurant.  They had a lunch special for $10.99 with fries and can‚Äôt remember if it included a drink. It felt like it was included but I got charged separately for it,  see picture in bill.  The Cajun fries were only half Cajun,  the other half tasted like Chemicals.  I got the first bill and it was $27.  I tell the waitress I had the special,  and she apologizes and takes about 5 minutes to correct after speaking to manager.  I get final bill in the picture,  and I just wanted to get out at this time.  As I‚Äôm putting the cash down, I get this feeling the waitress wants more tips.  I gave her $22 on the bill of $17.33.  She felt not too happy.  As I start walking out of the restaurant, I take a closer look at the bill,  and they had charged a 15% gratuity for sitting inside‚Ä¶.

50116792,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwdE4zN1B3EAE,I ordered the largest boil plus 2 eggs(The Reels Catch). I paid in cash and it amounted to almost $80. I went food shopping next door at food bazaar. Got home and DID NOT SEE ME EGGS AND ONLY 2 CRAB LEGS‚Ä¶everything else was in the bag. BTW my bag and all take out bags are put into a brown paper bag with handles that are sealed (I could not see what was inside).  I called and spoke to the same person who I paid in the Restaurant. When I explained that I was missing items she told me with hesitation that I could bring the food along with my receipt but she doubted that the manager would compensate me because I could have eaten it already. I found this statement strange as the manager should speak for themselves and perhaps should have taken this call. I also want to mention that the receptionist was very pleasant both in person and over the phone.  The manager was there when I ordered my takeout in the restaurant and never greeted myself or anyone else in the restaurant (in fact she; the manager looked annoyed and disgusted). I brushed it off as maybe something behind the scenes was or had transpired.  This was my first time at Hook&Reel in general. I will not return because I feel as though there is some sort of intentional bias as I was immediately discouraged from returning to make a complaint to the manager and was told that I would be blamed and assumed of lying about the amount of food that I purchased.  I live in NYC and WE are surrounded by other areas that offer much better and higher quality seafood (some at much better prices comparatively).  I recommend not buying/patronizing this establishment. If there is already a negative bias/assumption of the guests you are serving then the service will always be skewed.,2 months ago,2023-11-05 15:27:37.295656,1.0,C C,12,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110457632063340054183/reviews?hl=en,"['Service Take out', 'Meal type Dinner', 'Price per person $50‚Äì100', 'Food: 2', 'Service: 3', 'Atmosphere: 2']"

50116792,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LW9UWmJnEAE,The 236 East 161 st. Location I love Hook & Reel and frequent often at a few locations. I am glad there‚Äôs one close to me and for the most part my friends and family always enjoy. From the take out to the dining in. But This past Sunday Mother‚Äôs Day i was kind of disappointed. The food as always was delicious. But this time we was asked to limit our enjoyment to perhaps 90 minutes and I‚Äôm not sure if it was 90 minutes from when we walked in sat down or from when our food arrived. But no one should be rushed to enjoy their food especially when there were lots of tables still available.Also they didn‚Äôt offer Any usual specials and had No specials for Mother‚Äôs Day. So We paid more to be rushed out. This to me was a management issue because i have friends who went to  other Hook & Reels this same day and didn‚Äôt have this experience. It‚Äôs a shame to enjoy an establishment in my neighborhood and have it be distorted by greed and silliness just because it‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day and management didn‚Äôt know how to Organize.

50116792,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSODdTWnZ3RRAB,"I went here on Sunday with my daughter for the first time since they've opened up. I wasn't expecting a good outcome being that it's located in the Bronx, just being honest. I was surprised by the excellent customer service given from the moment we stepped into the door to the very moment we left. First of all, the waitress at the front greeted us with a genuine smile. (Not typical behavior from businesses in the Bronx,) She gave us a booth within a few minutes, wasn't a long wait. Not too long after, our assigned waiter came to our table and introduced himself. My daughter is very shy and quiet, so she's not good with talking to strangers. I'm sure he picked up on that and was very friendly, making her and myself feel comfortable. The whole time in between, he came to our table to check in on us. He was very patient, sweet, knowledgable on the menu and his vibes were definitely genuine. At the end, I gave him a tip but that wasn't good enough. I had to give this young man a good review online. The name on his tag is Kyle.  As for the food and drinks, it was good. The chicken was a bit salty, but it was also crispy so that made up for it. I didn't try their seafood so I can't rate that, (wasnt in the mood for it this day) Pricing was a bit high, but the positive environment the employees set for this place makes it worth it. In total, I will go to this place again, for sure. Good job to the owner of this restaurant for hiring a team of great people. THAT is what keeps customers like me coming back in the future, giving good tips AND bringing more customers for you by giving positive recommendations about your business. I'll definitely come back next time and try the seafood!",6 months ago,2023-11-05 15:27:37.345629,4.0,Brittany G,2,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116562757965152328968/reviews?hl=en,"['Service Dine in', 'Meal type Dinner', 'Price per person $30‚Äì50', 'Food: 4', 'Service: 5', 'Atmosphere: 5', 'Recommended dishes Wings, Fries', ""Kid-friendliness As I stated, my daughter is shy and only opens up to ppl she can read.

There‚Äôre a few 2-seater tables shared among all stalls, but aside from the 3 against wall, they are subject to foot traffic and people who are waiting.  So this is really geared for carry-out orders.  I don‚Äôt normally order this dish because it always gets preempted by other bolder dishes when I‚Äôm in town. Today nostalgia called and I made it a point to get it. It‚Äôs listed as ‚ÄúMixed Tempuras‚Äù on the menu; I‚Äôd subtitle it as ‚ÄúTempura Bowl with Broth‚Äù.   My MIL is right that it‚Äôs a dish we can easily make with ingredients from an Asian supermarket, but the sauce that accompanies the dish is crucial and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs readily available in stores.  The bowl consists of chunks of Daikon radishes, fish balls, fish cakes, seafood tofus, and fried tofus soaked in a pool of the magic sauce, with a cup of pork broth served separately. It was very temperature hot and very satisfying.  The soft and crunchy texture is very easy on the mouth.  I got what I came for and I highly recommend this dish.

50003346,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxMzZmTlFnEAE,"While the small space that houses Bombay Sandwich Company may seem innocuous, the food and flavors at this restaurant are beyond comprehension. Admittedly, like many Indian Americans, I fall into the ""nothing is as good as my Indian mother's food"" archetype, and that usually leaves me disappointed with most Indian restaurants.  And then I met the Bombay Sandwich Company.  What started with a chance encounter with the legendary Bombay Burger turned into a fully fledged love affair with their entire menu. Each dish is beautifully crafted, well thought-out, and the flavors masterfully harmonize on your palette. This isn't just an Indian restaurant, it's a true innovation in Indian cuisine that's trying to combat Indian food's greatest appeal and drawback - the heaviness that comes shortly after you eat a rich curry or tikka masala. A good paneer or chicken tikka masala is hard enough to execute, let alone trying to make dishes VEGAN and without the heavy cream that has come to define Indian dishes. Now you can enjoy the richness of Indian cuisine, without the heaviness that usually follows.  So, what's the secret? After a few visits, I found out. It's the owner, her passion for the food, and the wonderful staff who come together to deliver perfection. Nisha is a genius. She's not running a restaurant, she's orchestrating a symphony that you can experience by ordering any of her dishes. I hope New Yorkers everywhere come to this place to experience arguably the best Indian food I've had in NYC or London.  Bombay Sandwich Company is so good that you'll tell your Indian mother about it. In fact, she'll try it, and she'll fall in love with it.  Bombay Sandwich Company - keep on crushing it. You're a 3 star Michelin restaurant in my book already and I can't wait to share you with my friends everywhere. You rock.

Not too hot/spicy and not over-spiced, just the right amount of hand-blended spices. The bread ( I had two types) was very fresh. They wrap their sandwiches in liquid-barrier paper, cut once, to make eating less messy and so you can get it all in your mouth and not falling out on your plate/lap/table. Great idea!

It's usually quiet which makes it a nice rest stop for a quick bite when you're in the area.  The chana masala is the most popular item, but French lentils is my personal favorite, and let me tell you about the honey fennel grilled cheese...  I love the concept of a grilled cheese (who doesn't?), but the traditional grilled cheese gets me down a little (literally) when it's loaded with cheese and butter. The honey fennel grilled cheese here is the perfect ratio of bread to cheese, and they use mozzarella which isn't as decadent and still gooey and delicious. The raisins and honey gift it a little sweetness, and best of all it comes with a container of hot sauce which is just the cherry on top.

The service is poor and lacking organization from the staff of young girls that appear not to demonstrate any experience or professionalism.  I had been coming here about once a week and every time, i was given a reason not to come back. Either I was not explained that I had choices for substituting alternate style food items, not reflected on the menu. Or their poor selection of beers on tap and their wasteful inability to pour them. And the one time they allowed a minor behind the bar to serve customers drinks.  The only leadership I have noticed seems to be coming from that little hole in the wall they call a kitchen.
