The acai berry is 97 calories (per serving as per the sales lady) not to mention the fruits, coconut shavings and the Nutella (love, love, love it). So yeap!, once a week treat.",

Big downfall, they don't OPEN up early enough (smoothie on the run for breakfast omw to work) and the WAIT time is kind of annoying unless you pre order through an app. They NEED at least 3 people working. SOMEONE TO TAKE THE ORDERS! And two to expedite the orders and perfect the smoothies so business is booming! Hopefully, they read these reviews and consider help!",
