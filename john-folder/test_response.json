However the seafood is very fresh and tasty. You really have to bring a friend who knows their language so that they can order off menu items!\n\nThey allow smoking in the restaurant which I don't really like. It can get very noisy too sometimes.",

The prices are questionable since most the menu is \"SP\" which i think is market price.  They give you a peanut/pickled something dish as an appatizer which isnt bad.  The shrimp dish was a little pricey for what it was. But it was fresh.  And they have beer if you want it.  We also got two lobsters for $50 which isnt a great deal, but it did taste good.",

They have many lazy susan round tables that can fit large parties of ~10+. Not too busy during lunch weekdays.",
