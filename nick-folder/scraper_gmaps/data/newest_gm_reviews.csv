I feel that overall we‚Äôve lost the authentic taste of bubble tea made with real tea leaves, quality ingredients, and the focus on perfecting the boba that was such a staple from my childhood. But anything and everything I get from Boba Guys exceeds my expectations and I can finally say I‚Äôve found boba that I truly enjoy again. Their classic drinks never miss, and their seasonal specials are always creative and delicious. Anyone who asks me where to go for bubble I always direct them here, even my family members who live on the west coast always make Boba Guys a necessary stop in their trips here.
